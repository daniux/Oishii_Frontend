# Oishii_Frontend
This is the frontend directory of Oishii project. For details regarding this project, please refer README.<br/>
Oishii is a restaurant search and recommendation APP + service to improve personal experience for foodies.<br/>
This frontend includes an Android APP to communicate with backend DB to handle user request.<br/>
I guess many of you will ask why do we need this? We have Yelp already.<br/>
